# **POS TAGGER AND SPELL CHECKER WITH STOPWORDS IDENTIFICATION USING NLP**

Parts of Speech (POS) Tagging is a notable NLP topic that aimsinassigning each word of a text the proper syntactic tag in its context ofappearance. POS is a grammatical classification that commonly includes verbs, adjectives, adverbs, nouns, etc. DL and ML based POS taggers arebeingimplemented as potential solutions to efficiently identify words inagivensentence across a paragraph. Usually systems employ this tagging process for preprocessingthetext. There are mainly two approaches, they are Rule and Stochastic BasedApproach. My proposed approach use lateral entries in the dictionary alongwiththeirinformation. Here, it mainly depends on the frequency of occurrence of wordsinthe dictionary and identifying the meaning, the context they are referredaswell. While researchers use readily available stopwords lists that are derivedfromnon-technical resources, the technical jargon of engineering fields containstheirown highly frequent and uninformative words and there exists nostandardstopwords list for technical language processing applications
